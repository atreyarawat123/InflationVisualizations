# InflationVisualizations

Atreya Rawat

Using the consumer price index for all urban consumers, I explored all CPI categories instead of just working with a CPI value because there are several factors that go into changing inflation. The ultimate goal for this is to use inflation to predict stock prices for different companies. 

We also used the personal consumption expenditures data to make visualizations on how it changed from 1980 to 2020. We did both annual data and monthly data to amke these visualizations.

For this project, I depended on pandas...



# Data Prep

# Models

InflationVisualizations.ipynb is a jupyter notebook where I imported CPI data from bls.gov to make visualizations showing plots of CPI vs date from 2017 and also plots of change in CPI by month vs date from 2017. Here, I also made 7 day rolling average plots for each CPIFABSL and the change.
